Instruction for running executables:
All executable files are starter.py, Symmetry_Detector.py and Symmetry_Drawer.py. 
1. Change the path url of test set directory in starter.py
2. Create a new directory called 'testset' and download my test_set from my Dataset Link
3. 
Run 'python starter.py analyse_mode' in command line to enter analyse mode
Run 'python starter.py test_mode' in command line to enter test mode
Run 'python starter.py video_mode' in command line to enter real-time live stream mode
